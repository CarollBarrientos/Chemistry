<H1> Introduction </H1>
<p> In this website we will be reviewing the “Red Cabbage pH Indicator Experiment” tested in our Chemistry  <br> Lab, where a simple and natural method is used to analyze the acidity or basicity of various solutions: <br> purple cabbage juice as a pH indicator. This vegetable contains a substance called anthocyanin, a natural<br>  pigment that changes color depending on the pH level of the environment it is in. Thanks to this <br> property, purple cabbage juice can act as a visual indicator, making it easy to observe how pH varies <br> among different substances. The objective of the experiment is to demonstrate these color changes and <br> relate them to the approximate pH value of each tested solution.<br> </p>

<H1> Hypothesis: </H1>
<p> With each substance tested we might be able to see many different and colorful results due to their <br>difference in pH, having positive results in the experiment allowing us to understand and identify easily <br> which substances are acidic, neutral, or basic.<br> </p>
